# **Resident Networks**

Residentsâ€™ Networks (RNs) are set up to promote neighbourliness, social cohesion and acts as a bridge between the people and the Government. Did you know that the RNs are led by grassroots volunteers living in the estate? They could just be your friendly next-door neighbour!

By working closely with the government agencies and community partners, RNs help residents know one another better, seek to understand local needs, concerns, and aspirations, as well as help communicate government messages.
