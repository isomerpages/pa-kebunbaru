<h3><strong>Welcome to Our Kebun Baru!</strong></h3><p>Our name <strong>Kebun Baru</strong> is adapted from former Kampong Kebun Baharu and means “<strong>New Garden</strong>” in Malay. Living up to our name, we are a tranquil and thriving district bounded by a town park. Home to both public and private estates as well as an array of amenities, we are snugly located in the West of Ang Mo Kio.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/our%20heritage%20image.PNG"></div><p>Kebun Baru strives to play a part in creating a happy, caring neighbourhood for our people to live together as one community. Our team of dedicated volunteers is committed to provide our residents with a range of activities all year round, bringing people and communities together.</p><p>The revamped Kebun Baru Community Club was officially opened on 26 August 2018. It focuses on creating a caring and inclusive Kebun Baru community and features amenities for families and neighbours, such as lounge areas, rooftop barbecue pits, sports and pre-school facilities, and a senior care centre.</p><p></p>
