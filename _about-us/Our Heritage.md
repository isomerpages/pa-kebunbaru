# **Welcome to Our Kebun Baru!**
![](/images/our%20heritage%20image.PNG)

Our name **Kebun Baru** is adapted from former Kampong Kebun Baharu and means “**New Garden**” in Malay. Living up to our name, we are a tranquil and thriving district bounded by a town park. Home to both public and private estates as well as an array of amenities, we are snugly located in the West of Ang Mo Kio. 

Kebun Baru strives to play a part in creating a happy, caring neighbourhood for our people to live together as one community. Our team of dedicated volunteers is committed to provide our residents with a range of activities all year round, bringing people and communities together.

The revamped Kebun Baru Community Club was officially opened on 26 August 2018. It focuses on creating a caring and inclusive Kebun Baru community and features amenities for families and neighbours, such as lounge areas, rooftop barbecue pits, sports and pre-school facilities, and a senior care centre.
