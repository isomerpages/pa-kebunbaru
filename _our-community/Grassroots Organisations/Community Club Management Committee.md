<h3><strong>Kebun Baru Community Club Management Committee</strong></h3><p>The Kebun Baru Community Club Management Committee (CCMC) assists to manage the CC and ensure that facilities are serving our residents in the best way. The Kebun Baru CCMC also plans and organise programmes to bring residents together, such as the Kebun Baru Family Day 2023, where the first constituency-based Dads for Life group was launched in Kebun Baru. </p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ccmc.png"></div><p></p>
