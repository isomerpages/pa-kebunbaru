##### **Volunteering with the Grassroots Organisations (GROs)**

GROs are managed by appointed grassroots volunteers. As a grassroots volunteer, you will organise a wide range of programmes for residents to meet and interact. You will play a pivotol role in bringing people from all walks of life together and encourage community involvement, raise awareness about community issues, explain government policies and gather feedback, and also help those in need to strengthen our communities.

There are many GROs that you can volunteer with at Kebun Baru. Find out more here.

Join us as a grassroots volunteer by filling up this [Volunteer Registration Form](/files/Volunteer_Registration_Form__2023_.pdf).

You may e-mail the form to us at pa_kebunbarucc@pa.gov.sg or submit the form at our CC counter from 10am - 6pm (Mon - Sun, excluding PH). 

##### **Volunteering as a Community Volunteer** 
The Community Volunteer scheme aims to offer more flexibility in choosing specific cause-based or skills-based volunteering opportunities that you wish to contribute towards. As compared to GROs, you may determine your level of commitment such as on ad-hoc, once-off event basis. Meet like-minded individuals and come together to volunteer as a group towards a common community goal. 

Sign up as a Community Volunteer [here](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/events/community-volunteers-needed--kebun-baru-co-71814060).
