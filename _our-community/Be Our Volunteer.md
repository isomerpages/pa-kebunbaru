##### **Volunteering with the Grassroots Organisations (GROs)**

GROs are managed by appointed grassroots volunteers. As a grassroots volunteer, you will organise a wide range of programmes for residents to meet and interact. You will play a pivotol role in bringing people from all walks of life together and encourage community involvement, raise awareness about community issues, explain government policies and gather feedback, and also help those in need to strengthen our communities.

There are many GROs that you can volunteer with at Kebun Baru. They include:
