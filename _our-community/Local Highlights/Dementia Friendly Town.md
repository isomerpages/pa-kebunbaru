<h3><strong>Dementia Friendly Community</strong></h3>
<p>Kebun Baru is committed to build an inclusive and dementia-friendly community
and town in our constituency. Working together with <strong>Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA)</strong> and <strong>Dementia Singapore</strong>,
we have worked together with <strong>volunteers </strong>and <strong>community partners</strong> to
implement inclusive initiatives in Kebun Baru, with two notable projects
standing out thus far.</p>

<h4><strong>Wayfinding Project</strong></h4>
<p>Addressing challenges in wayfinding, we carried out a mural-painting initiative
with the support of our Town Council, Kebun Baru Grassroots, Artists, Community
Volunteers, and Persons with Dementia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project features murals strategically placed at the void decks of
HDB blocks that incorporates familiar, retro items to assist persons living
with dementia and the elderly in recognising and navigating their surroundings.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>"Talk to Me" Video Series: Inter-Generational Conversations</strong></h4>
<p>Collaborating with Kebun Baru CCMC, Child@Street 11, and St Luke’s ElderCare,
ADA produced a series of videos fostering conversations between children
and seniors with dementia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the tagline “Talk to me. I’m still me despite dementia,” these videos
aim to break stereotypes, raise awareness, and encourage residents to engage
with their grandparents or elderly neighbors living with dementia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four-part series showcases seniors with dementia being interviewed
by children, addressing topics like their youth, life advice, and emotions
related to memory loss.</p>
