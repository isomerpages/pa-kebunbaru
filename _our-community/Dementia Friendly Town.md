<h3><strong>Dementia Friendly Community</strong></h3><p>Kebun Baru is committed to build an inclusive and dementia-friendly community and town in our constituency. Working together with Alzheirmer's Disease Association (ADA) and Dementia Singapore, we have worked together with volunteers and community partners to implement inclusive initiatives in Kebun Baru, with two notable projects standing out.</p><hr><h4><strong>Wayfinding Project</strong></h4><p>Addressing challenges in wayfinding, we carried out a mural-painting initiative with the support of our Town Council, Kebun Baru Grassroots, Artists, Community Volunteers, and Persons with Dementia. The project featured murals strategically placed at the void decks of HDB blocks that incorporates familiar, retro items to assist persons living with dementia and the elderly in recognising and navigating their surroundings.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/dementia_wayfinding.png"></div><p></p><hr><h4><strong>"Talk to Me" Video Series: Inter-Generational Conversations </strong></h4><p>Collaborating with Kebun Baru CCMC, Child@Street 11, and St Luke’s ElderCare, ADA produced a series of videos fostering conversations between children and seniors with dementia. With the tagline “Talk to me. I’m still me despite dementia,” these videos aim to break stereotypes, raise awareness, and encourage residents to engage with their grandparents or elderly neighbors living with dementia. The four-part series showcases seniors with dementia being interviewed by children, addressing topics like their youth, life advice, and emotions related to memory loss.</p><p><em>Watch the heartwarming videos below.</em></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLRuN2I8sFs?si=abqWPNXqWZRTgQpg"></iframe></div><p></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rF4vgq3I884?si=RwYINpWg6YtgFuy2"></iframe></div><p></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMVY5Gd1dgA?si=34tVkjp-sCGP8Wr6"></iframe></div><p></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4olHbiIkO_8?si=U6JuW1u4DM-rT8o3"></iframe></div><p></p>
