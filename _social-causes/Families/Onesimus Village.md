<p>Additionally, a café named Onesimus is supported by a group of dedicated
volunteers and kind sponsors to allow residents to drop by for a cup of
freshly brewed coffee. A Pay-Forward system has been implemented so that
residents can purchase another drink for those in need.</p>
<p>Onesimus Café also provides training opportunities for residents who wish
to become a barista which will further job opportunities for the residents.&nbsp;Volunteers
from Salem Chapel also provide free education to support children, who
are mainly from Block 113 and nearby flats.</p>
