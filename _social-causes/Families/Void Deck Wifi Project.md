<h3><strong>Kebun Baru Void Deck Wifi Project</strong></h3><p>The Kebun Baru Void Deck Wifi Project is a pilot programme by Beyond Social Services to help bridge the digital divide in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>This project was formed after speaking with residents from Kebun Baru who shared their valuable insights and aspirations for what they wanted in their neighborhood.&nbsp;The discussion included topics like having a nearby childrenâ€™s playground with a space for ball game activities, a cozy corner at the void deck and a more organised resident-led volunteer group to redistribute donated food.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 circuit- breaker had further aggravated the digital divide - especially for the lower-income families who lack resources.&nbsp;Hence, this programme aims to provide free WiFi access to the lower-income families. They have piloted this by providing free wi-fi access to residents in rental blocks in Block 115 and 245. <br></p>
