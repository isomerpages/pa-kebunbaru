<h3><strong>Kebun Baru Void Deck Wifi Project</strong></h3>
<p>The Kebun Baru Void Deck Wifi Project is a pilot programme launched by
Beyond Social Services to help bridge the digital divide in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project was conceptualised after speaking with residents from Kebun
Baru who shared their valuable insights and aspirations for what they wanted
in their neighborhood.&nbsp;The discussion included topics like having
a nearby childrenâ€™s playground with a space for ball game activities, a
cozy corner at the void deck and a more organised resident-led volunteer
group to redistribute donated food.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 circuit- breaker had further aggravated the digital divide
- especially for the lower-income families who lack resources, this programme
aims to provide free WiFi access to the lower-income families. They have
piloted this by providing free wi-fi access to residents in rental blocks
in Block 245.</p>
