<h3><strong>TOUCH Young Arrows</strong></h3>
<p>TOUCH Young Arrows, a service of TOUCH Community Services, consists of
a team of committed and regular volunteers who conduct weekly programmes
at Kebun Baru CC to meet childrenâ€™s needs.&nbsp;Their vision is to see
Nurtured Children, Strong Families and Enabled Volunteers, through programmes
conducted by committed teams of volunteer coaches.</p>

<p>The team provides small group academic coaching (English and Mathematics)
for a group of children who are between the age of 5 and 14.&nbsp;Additionally,
volunteers will plan various weekly activities for the children to build
character, resilience and social skills through fun and play to meet their
social and emotional needs. These provide a conducive environment for them
to nurture and grow.</p>
