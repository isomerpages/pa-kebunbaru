<h3><strong>Project Phileo</strong></h3>
<p>Project Phileo is a seniors’ befriending project that serves isolated
seniors and seniors who are living alone without any social or family support
in Kebun Baru precinct.&nbsp;Its aim is to provide seniors a support system
and to build a good and healthy relationship with our volunteers. It also
aims to take care of the seniors’ health, meals and daily needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our volunteers are also activated to escort seniors for their routine
medical checks as many seniors could not comply with their medical appointments
for several chronic illness at hospitals and polyclinic.&nbsp;Seniors are
also brought on outings twice a year.</p>
