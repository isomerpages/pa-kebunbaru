<h3><strong>Mother's Day Outreach &amp; Celebrations</strong></h3>
<p>This year, our grassroots organisations came together to celebrate Mother's
Day in the most heartwarming ways! From delightful community breakfasts
to fun flower arrangement classes, we truly embraced the spirit of gratitude
and togetherness. It was a joyous occasion dedicated to honoring and appreciating
the amazing mothers in our lives.</p>
<p>Oh, and did you happen to spot our volunteers at Mayflower Market and
Food Centre, spreading joy with fresh flowers? If not, keep an eye out
for us next year â€“ you won't want to miss it!</p>
