<h2>An Evening of Flamenco in Kebun Baru</h2>

<p>The highlight of the evening was <em>Puntal</em>, a masterpiece that embodies
the essence of <em>Arte Flamenco</em>. Renowned dancer David Perez transported
the audience into the heart of this emotive art form, supported by Flamenco's
three pillars: the soul-stirring voice, the lifegiving guitar, and the
expressive language of dance.</p>
<p>The performance was a rare opportunity for residents to immerse themselves
in the universal language of Flamenco, an art form that transcends borders
to inspire and unite.</p>
