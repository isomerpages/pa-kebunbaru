<h3><strong>Kebun Baru Family Day &amp; PAssionArts Festival 2024</strong></h3>
<p>The Kebun Baru Family Day &amp; PassionArts Festival 2024 was a resounding
success, featuring an amazing array of sports tryouts, interactive arts,
interest group activities, games, and delectable food. The event was a
true testament to the vibrant spirit and unity of our community.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the day was the launch of our new AI Interest
Group, Good Robot, which brought together tech enthusiasts and innovators
to explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. Additionally,
we were thrilled to celebrate our entry into the Singapore Book of Records
for the Largest Display of Crocheted Food Items with 501 pieces, a remarkable
achievement that showcased the creativity and dedication of our community
members.</p>
<p>For those who couldn't make it, the event's most exciting moments were
captured in the video. And the festivities were far from over! The evening
continued at Kebun Baru CC with an exhilarating getai performance that
capped off this unforgettable day. The night was filled with music, laughter,
and a sense of togetherness that truly embodied the spirit of our community.</p>
