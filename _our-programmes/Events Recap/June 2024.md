<h3><strong>Crochet Art Workshop Series</strong></h3>
<p>We were thrilled to have kicked off our crochet workshop series organised
by Kebun Baru Community Arts &amp; Culture Club (CACC)! A heartfelt thank
you to all who joined us across the 6 sessions across the month of June.
It was a delightful gathering of creativity, learning, and community spirit.
Together, we explored the art of crochet, shared tips and techniques, and
crafted beautiful pieces.</p>
<p>The pieces came together to form a Kebun Baru Logo display and took on
the challenge to set the record for the Largest Display of Crochet Food
Items in July. Check our July tab for how we fared!</p>
